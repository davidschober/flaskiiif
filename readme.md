## Overview
This is an IIIF server in flask using iiif.py. This was cribbed from the iiif example and tweaked to allow for caching and hardwired to .tifs. 

Later I plan to move to port this to chalice to see how it will run on a Lambda.

## To try it it out


```
virtualenv 
pip install flask
pip install iiif.py
pip install pillow


```
